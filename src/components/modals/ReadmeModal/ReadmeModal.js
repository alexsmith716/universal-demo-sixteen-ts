                          A meeting place for the 2020 Primary! Cast your vote of opinion and discuss what's going on. Well, it was at first. Currently, the app is an evolving JS playground.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Why? Because I really enjoy the challenge and reward of modern JavaScript development. Instead of creating alot of small projects with a single focus, I just keep building upon this one. I have spent many, many, hours working on this "app" and therefore various aspects of modern JS development. I am no expert on this stuff and am occasionally very humbled by how complex the work is.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Initially inspired by Erik Rasmussen's, <a href="https://github.com/erikras" rel="nofollow">@erikras</a> and Kévin Berthommier's, <a href="https://github.com/bertho-zero" rel="nofollow">@bertho-zero</a> <a href="https://github.com/bertho-zero/react-redux-universal-hot-example" rel="nofollow">react-redux-universal-hot-example</a>. I have since directly used a few components and pieces of code from the original ("RouterTrigger.js", "configureStore.js") but have also re-worked and built out a fair amount as well including the app build process, webpack development build and css modules. I'm actually not 100% sure if the different approaches I used in my code are better than the original app's but it helps in better understanding what is going on with node, server/client, universal rendering, sync/async, transpiling, webpack, scss and bascially everything JavaScript.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Component "clientMiddleware.js" is interesting because that amazingly simple and effective solution goes back to the genius himself <a href="https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/issues/99#issuecomment-112212639" rel="nofollow">Best async serverside loading technique?</a>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          This app is for Heroku. It does not include the development build code.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          I had to heavily modify this app from a working, error-free desktop ENV to simply working on Heroku. It took days and days and days to get a handle on Heroku memory constraints. Much code was removed and some was added. All custom ('@font-face' and '@fortawesome') fonts had to be removed. It was extensive trial and error. If you see a "Status Code 404!" it means module was purposely removed from build. The Heroku "process" was interesting and a fair amount was learned from it. I have to say I am still not 100% sure original code is leak free!
